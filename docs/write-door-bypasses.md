# Close the write-door bypasses

> **Model routing** (2026-07-05 campaign, `docs/backlog-campaign-2026-07-05.md`; self-sufficient):
> - **Explore: —. Spec: Opus / medium. Spec-review: Opus / medium. Build: Opus / medium** — boundary machinery, but the boundaries themselves (NameValidator, `_normalize_address_fields`) already exist and are tested; this is routing every door through them.
> - Sequencing: Phase 2, **after WI-004** — the consolidated write primitive WI-004 ships is the natural single place to hang these checks (solve-in-one-place; don't bolt them onto six doors that WI-004 is about to collapse).

## Problem / Motivation

WI-105/WI-109 built real boundaries, but they only guard the create path (2026-07-05 review, findings N2/N3):

- **N2 — NameValidator is create-only.** `NameValidator().clean` runs only inside `create_stub` (person.py:1371-1379). A direct `repo.save(person)` or `update_fields(person, {"name": ...})` (which auto-manipulates name/aliases, base.py:260-265) writes an arbitrary or renamed name with no Tier-1 validation and no path-hostile `/` check — exactly the inputs WI-105 rejects, entering through the non-create doors.
- **N3 — RFC 2822 normalization bypassed on identifier write-back.** `_normalize_address_fields` runs only in `PersonRepository.save()` (person.py:1239); `_writeback_identifier` (person.py:1176-1188) appends raw email/phone strings via `update_fields`, which doesn't normalize — so `Name <email>` can land unnormalized in `emails[]`, breaking exact-email dedupe (the WI-109 corruption, back through a side door).
- **Consolidation rider:** RFC 2822 parsing now lives in ≥4 sites (`create_stub` parseaddr person.py:1352, `_normalize_address_fields` person.py:1257-1263, `identifier.Email.parse` identifier.py:145-160, `name_validation._RFC2822_LEAK_RE`). Collapse to one authority.

## Intent

There is no door into the vault through which an unvalidated name or unnormalized address can pass. One RFC 2822 parse authority; an invariant test per closed door.

## Currency note — 2026-08-11 (queue review)

Premise re-verified against the post-WI-004 tree: still live. `_writeback_identifier` (now
person.py:1192) still appends raw identifiers via `update_fields`; `_normalize_address_fields`
(now :1278, called from save at :1269) still runs only in `PersonRepository.save()`;
NameValidator still fires only on the create path. Line numbers above have drifted — re-derive
at spec time, don't trust the 07-05 citations. Relationship to WI-004: vault_io closed the
MECHANICAL write door (atomicity/locking/stamps); this item is the SEMANTIC layer on the same
door — validation and normalization on every path that reaches it. Deps satisfied (WI-004 done
2026-08-11); unblocked.
